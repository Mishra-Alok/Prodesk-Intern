Hi, I am Alok and this is my week 1 project.

00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
This is my HTML file.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,400
This is my CSS file

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and this is my JS file.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These are my assets like Instagram logo, linkedin logo, etc.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now I'm going to open my project on my local system, where i'm going to show the UI part of my project.

00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Now this is additional feature toggle mode i.e. dark mode and light mode.
